    <!-- The sender field is very important for branching or silent mission chains. Even if this file you're editing isn't the
    email on the server the player will be responding to, it will still run it's completion checks as long as the player is responding to
    any email from the same sender. This doesn't affect basic and normal missions, so if you're not doing anything too fancy,
    don't worry about it.-->

       Hi, #PLAYERNAME#, here's the link to the hub server. I'm counting on you.

    <!-- The attachments are the clickable items at the bottom of the email with a small "+"
    You can have as many attachments as you want, of any kind, but I recommend keeping the number small
    whenever possible, so the player can be focused on a single goal, and not be too overwhelmed.
    Even if you have no attachments, make sure you include the opening and closing tag (with nothing inside)
    They are required for the formatting.
